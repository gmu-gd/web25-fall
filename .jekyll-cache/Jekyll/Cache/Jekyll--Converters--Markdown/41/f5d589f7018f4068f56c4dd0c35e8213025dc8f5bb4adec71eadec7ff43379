<p>Using our simpler definition of usability â€” How easy is it for <span class="command">someone</span> to use <span class="command">something</span>? â€” find something in your daily life that you would consider not so usable. There are examples at the end of the slides (linked on Canvas) we talked about in class (which you canâ€™t use) but can give you an idea of what this exercise is looking for.</p>
