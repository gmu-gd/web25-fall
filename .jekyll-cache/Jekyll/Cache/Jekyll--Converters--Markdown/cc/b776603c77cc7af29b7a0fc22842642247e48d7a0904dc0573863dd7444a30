<p>Link the artboards of your e1 file together by adding some kind of navigation. How you link them together is up to you but the minimum is 1 should go to 2, 2 should go to 3, 3 should go to 4, 4 should go to the new 5th page and 5 should go back to 1. This is also a chance to update the design if you need to either to improve it or to adjust for the navigation elements.</p>
