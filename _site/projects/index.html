      <h4 id="exercise-3-translations">Exercise 3: Translations</h4>
<p>Words on their own carry a lot of meaning. That meaning can be emphasized by how the type is treated. In a very simple example, look at the difference between “bold” and “BOLD”. The word didn’t change but making the word all caps and bold made the word more impactful. For this exercise, you will be visually expressing the meaning of the words by making typographic transformations to those words.</p>

<p>Pick five of the words in the list below and set each one on its own 7”x7” white piece of paper in black <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/futura-pt">Futura Bold</a>. You can express the meaning of a word or an idea through spacing, sizing, and placement of letters of each word on the page. This means you should think about things such as point size, tracking, kerning, capitalization, weight, and position of the word and its letters on the page. You should not be altering the letter forms themselves. That means you should not stretch or squish the letters in any direction. Also do not have anything other than the word on the page.</p>

      <h4 id="exercise-2-physical-grids">Exercise 2: Physical Grids</h4>
<p>Use the three provided grids (PDFs on Blackboard) and create layouts on them physically or digitally.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Physical Layouts – cut pieces from magazines, newspapers, packinging, etc. and glue them onto the page adhering to the grid. This means you will need to measure the space you want to fill and cut a piece out to fit that space.</li>
  <li>Digital Layouts – take screenshots of websites (text and images) and use those screenshots to place into the grid. The screenshots need to be cropped to fit precisely into the grid.</li>
</ul>

<p>The grids should be strictly adhered to while creating your layouts and should keep in mind the hierarchy of the page.The layouts should be abstract and use images and text but they do not need to represent an actual layout with words and pictures. The grid does not need to be full and there should be open white space in your final layout.</p>

<h5 id="requirements">Requirements</h5>
<ul>
  <li>three layouts using the three grids</li>
  <li>text and images on the layouts that adhere to the grid</li>
  <li>images added to figma</li>
  <li>images uploaded to blackboard</li>

      <h4 id="exercise-1-letter-croppings">Exercise 1: Letter Croppings</h4>
<p>On five 6” squares, present a section of a letterform that highlights its unique characteristics, keeping in mind the contrast between form and counterform. Each of your crops will use a typeface from Adobe fonts that fits into one of the following typeface classifications: any serif, modern serif, slab serif, any sans serif, script, blackletter. Once you find a typeface that fits the appropriate category, select a letter and crop into it. The crop should ideally focus on one of the aspects that identifies that classification of type but could also focus on something unique about that specific letter. The original letter does not necessarily need to be recognizable but the specific characteristic you are looking at should. Include the name and designer of the typeface in 10pt Acumin Pro Bold (on Adobe fonts).</p>
