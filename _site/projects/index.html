      <h4 id="exercise-10-5-usability-heuristics">Exercise 10: 5 Usability Heuristics</h4>
<p><em>Part 1: Find examples with your group</em></p>

<p>Find examples of 5 of the 10 Usability Heuristics using the <a href="https://mmcdermott18.github.io/avt415-fa24/e10/index.html">Exercise 10 Generator</a>. The generator will randomly assign 5 of the 10 heuristics and you and your group will find web based examples for each one you were assigned. For each heuristic, find an example from a website and take a screenshot of it. The screenshots can be cropped in but they need to include any supporting elements to help visually show the heuristic.</p>

<p><em>Part 2: Individually design your presentation</em></p>

<p>Once you have an example for each of your heuristics, create five frames in Figma that are 1440px by 768px with each containing the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A screenshot showing the example of one of your heuristics.</li>
  <li>Include a link to the website where the screenshot is from.</li>
  <li>The title and definition of the heuristic from the slides (find a link to the slides on Canvas).</li>
  <li>A brief explanation explaining why you are using this screenshot as an example.</li>
</ul>

<p>To finish, link the frames together and submit the link to your prototype on Canvas and add it to your website.</p>

<h5 id="technical-requirements">Technical Requirements</h5>
<ul>
  <li>5 frames at 1440px by 796px</li>
  <li>Uses a grid (columns)</li>

<p>Using our simpler definition of usability — How easy is it for <span class="command">someone</span> to use <span class="command">something</span>? — find something in your daily life that you would consider not so usable. There are examples at the end of the slides (linked on Canvas) we talked about in class (which you can’t use) but can give you an idea of what this exercise is looking for.</p>

<p>Create a single artboard in XD that is 1440px by 768px and contains the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An image showing your not so usable thing</li>
  <li>The above definition filled out for your not so usable thing (for example, How easy is it for a person to use a door?)</li>
  <li>Some amount of text describing the not so usable thing and why it is not so usable.</li>

<p>Reverse engineer two wireframes for the <a href="https://www.nga.gov/">National Gallery of Art</a>. The first wireframe should be at a desktop width. If your screen is wide enough try at 1440px but if it is smaller just get it as wide as it can be. The second wireframe should be at a mobile width. Use your phone to view the page in a portrait format. One of the wireframes will be done digitally and one will be done by hand. It is up to you which is which. The hand done wireframe needs to be done nicely and brought back in to your Figma file. The digital wireframe should use a grid that is close to the same grid used on the site.</p>

<p>Both wireframes should be in black and white (grey is acceptable but typically not necessary) and contain no text or images. They both will also be the full height of the website and diagram out all the information on the page. This should be done entirely using shapes and lines. Come up with representations for various levels of type and how you will represent images, graphics, videos, etc.</p>

The page will be 1440px by 796px which means it will not scroll. The page should use a grid and any animation or interaction you want to include should be prototyped. There are multiple levels of typographic information here so focus on the hierarchy.</p>

<p>The contents of the page will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The 66th Grammy Awards</li>
  <li>Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles</li>
  <li>Sunday, February 4, 2024</li>

<p>Redesign the Craigslist “Post an Ad” form - <a href="https://post.craigslist.org/">post.craigslist.org/</a> (washington, DC &gt;northern virginia &gt;for sale &gt; free stuff). You only have to redesign the “Free Stuff” part of the form but if you want to design and prototype the previous form pages you can. You can edit the content but all the collected information must remain the same. Questions could also be edited for clarity and/or length.</p>

<p>You are only designing the form, not coding it, and it should be designed in Figma at 1440px wide. It can be on a single page or split up across multiple pages. Interactive features should be designed and prototyped.</p>

<h5 id="technical-requirements">Technical Requirements</h5>
<ul>
  <li>1440px wide by however tall</li>
  <li>All the same information is collected</li>

<p>Add hover effects to your links from Exercise 2. Each link on each artboard should have a hover effect for it. If you want to work in some kind of animation you can do that too.

<p>Link the artboards of your e1 file together by adding some kind of navigation. How you link them together is up to you but the minimum is 1 should go to 2, 2 should go to 3, 3 should go to 4, 4 should go to the new 5th page and 5 should go back to 1. This is also a chance to update the design if you need to either to improve it or to adjust for the navigation elements.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add an additional artboard as number 5 that tells the typeface(s) and foundry(s) that designed it</li>
