        <h2 class="page-title"> Syllabus </h2>
        <h3 id="general">General</h3>
<p>This is the syllabus for the <em>Summer 2024</em> class of <em>AVT 215: Typography (3 credits)</em>. The instructor is <em>Michael McDermott</em>, can be reached by email at <em>mmcderm8 at gmu dot edu</em>, and can be met with in his office hours by scheduling a <a href="https://calendly.com/michaelmcdermott">virtual meeting</a></p>

<h3 id="delivery-and-timing">Delivery and Timing</h3>
<p>We will meet twice a week on Zoom on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4:30 to 7:10. The classes are required and during our sessions we will discuss work, complete demos, and further our design knowledge. The class is scheduled to run for 9 weeks and you can expect to work for 12 hours outside of class each week.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>AVT 110: Digital Design Studio</p>

<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
<p>Introduction to the history and use of type. Projects and exercises develop awareness of type as a linguistic and visual communication tool. Introduces typographic design elements, including color, hierarchy, integration with imagery, structure, and content.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Type is everywhere. The only way to avoid it is to close your eyes and even then you still might see it. During this class we will start by looking at the form and structure of letters and then combine those letters to make words, sentences and paragraphs. We will make type by hand, print type digitally, and set type to be viewed on screen. We will learn that the style, weight, size, and color of the type we choose can say just as much as the words we write with it. We will also have various exercises and demos during class to improve your skills and knowledge of the tools available to you. Finally we will talk about the anatomy of type, the history of type, and the type designers who create the type. By the end of the class you will have a strong basis in the fundamentals of typography to use in your evolving design practice.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Understand the anatomy and evolution of the roman letterform</li>
  <li>Learn the terms and principles of working with type as a designer</li>
  <li>Develop essential craft, critique and presentation skills</li>
  <li>Learn and apply basic layout skills in InDesign</li>
  <li>Understand and explore the use of grid systems</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="recommended-books">Recommended Books</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Inside Paragraphs by <em>Cyrus Highsmith</em></li>
  <li>Thinking with Type by <em>Ellen Lupton</em></li>
  <li>The Elements of Typographic Style by <em>Robert Bringhurst</em></li>
  <li>A Type Primer by <em>John Kane</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Glue Sticks</li>
  <li>Scissors</li>
  <li>Knife &amp; Cutting Mat</li>
  <li>Straight Edge / Metal Ruler</li>
  <li>Bone Folder</li>
  <li>Scissors</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="programs">Programs</h3>
<p>We will be using the Adobe Creative Suite in this class, primarily InDesign and Illustrator but will also use some Photoshop. An internet browser will also be necessary as we will submit work through Blackboard and document process on Figma. See the Technology Requirements section for more information.</p>

<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>This class consists of  shorter exercises, in-class demos and workshops, and longer projects. The exercises, demos, and workshops are meant to build skills and learn new concepts and the projects are a place to demonstrate your understanding and ability to combine those skills and concepts.</p>

<h4 id="project-1-paper-letters">project 1: paper letters</h4>
<p>You will work on making letters from black and white paper focusing on expressive and unique letters, not replicating letters that already exist. You will start by making one letter and then use that letter to create more letters making sure the letters belong next to each other. You will then digitize the letters and further refine them. The goal of this project is to begin to closely examine letterforms and start to notice different aspects of typefaces.</p>

<h4 id="project-2-type-specimen">project 2: type specimen</h4>
<p>Design a single page type specimen for a given typeface. The project will entail a small amount of research to find some specific information about the typeface. That information will be used to inform the design and the final designs will be two colors and printed with a Risograph. You will then get to collect prints from everyone and bind them into a book to keep. The project will focus on principles of typography as well as hierarchy, grids, and craft.</p>

<h4 id="project-3-various">project 3: various</h4>
<p>You will have the choice between three different projects—designing a poster, a booklet, or an album. Each project will have unique constraints and guidelines and will be a culmination of the skills and concepts you have learned throughout this course.</p>

<h3 id="engagement">Engagement</h3>
<p>This course has an engagement policy instead of an attendance policy. Your engagement will affect your final grade (and, by extension, the quality of your work) for this course. You are expected to actively and passionately take part in this course in the following ways.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attend class meetings</li>
  <li>Create things and be prepared to show them on time.</li>
  <li>Make things thoughtfully, intentionally, and with intensity.</li>
  <li>Meet all deadlines for handing in work and process.</li>
  <li>Actively participate in critiques both in class and out of class.</li>
  <li>Be curious about making things and the things your classmates make.</li>
  <li>Care about yourself &amp; your work, your classmates &amp; their work, and this class.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>Grades will be based on quizzes (10%), engagement (25%), exercises (25%), and projects (40%).</p>

<h4 id="quizzes-10">quizzes (10%)</h4>
<p>There will be short, weekly quizzes to assess your knowledge of typographic terms, concepts, and history that will account for 10% of your grade.</p>

<h4 id="engagement-25">engagement (25%)</h4>
<p>This percentage will be based on your engagement in the class which is explained on above. Be engaged in this course and its content throughout the semester and this should be an easy 25%.</p>

<h4 id="exercises-25">exercises (25%)</h4>
<p>The exercises are meant to be quicker, skill building tasks that improve your projects and design knowledge. They are graded using a basic rubric show on the last page.</p>

<h4 id="projects-40">projects (40%)</h4>
<p>Each project will generate two different grades. One grade will be based on your week to week process and the second grade will be based on the final submission. At the end of the semester you will have 6 total project grades that are all weighted equally for this 40%.</p>

<h3 id="rubrics">Rubrics</h3>
<p>Rubrics are used to grade exercises, projects, and checkpoints. The rubrics are in the PDF syllabus and tied to each submission on Blackboard. The rubrics are here to allow you to understand how work is graded and to reference while working to self-evaluate.</p>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>Your ability to communicate with me is of prime importance in this course. If you are going to be absent, late, or not have your work, it will be your best interest in communicating those things to me in advance. I do not need to know your reasons for being absent, late, or not having your work but I do need to know. A simple, short email will be fine.</p>

<p>The same goes for if you are struggling in this class or having other issues that are hindering your ability to complete work in this class. The more you keep me in the loop the more I can help you and adjust as needed.</p>

<h3 id="weekly-schedule">Weekly Schedule</h3>
<p>Class is on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4:30–7:10. Most days we will meet for the entire time but some weeks we will have individual meetings or end early. Unless otherwise specified, all work is due at the beginning of class.</p>

<p>A note—Time management is an important skill to master and should be worked on all your classes. Staying up all night working is not a badge of honor, it typically means you didn’t budget your time correctly. Staying up all night isn’t healthy and making sure you are keeping yourself healthy is your first priority.</p>

<h3 id="semester-schedule">Semester Schedule</h3>
<p>The <a href="/schedule/">schedule</a> on this site is an outline of what we will be covering this summer. It is subject to additions and subtractions.</p>

<h3 id="discussion-of-work">Discussion of Work</h3>
<p>You will need to take an active role in both the presentation and discussion of your work. We will review projects in a variety of ways and you are expected to be able to talk and write about your own work and give feedback to your peers about their work. The ability to discuss your work and other student’s work is a very important part of your education at Mason. Use this class to improve on those skills.</p>

<h3 id="attendance-policies">Attendance Policies</h3>
<p>Students are expected to attend the class periods of the courses for which they register. In-class (including sections that meet online) participation is important not only to the individual student, but also to the class as a whole. Because class participation may be a factor in grading, instructors may use absence, tardiness, or early departure as de facto evidence of non-participation. Students who miss an exam with an acceptable excuse may be penalized according to the individual instructor’s grading policy, as stated in the course syllabus.</p>

<h3 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h3>
<p>To promote a stronger sense of mutual responsibility, respect, trust, and fairness among all members of the George Mason University Community and with the desire for greater academic and personal achievement, we, the student members of the university community, have set forth this Honor Code: Student Members of the George Mason University community pledge not to cheat, plagiarize, steal, or lie in matters related to academic work. <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/">https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/</a></p>

<h3 id="anti-racism-statement">Anti-Racism Statement</h3>
<p>The School of Art plays an integral role in building an educational environment that is committed to anti-racism and inclusive excellence. An anti-racist approach to higher education acknowledges the ways that individual, interpersonal, institutional, and structural manifestations of racism against Black, Indigenous, and other people of color contribute to inequality and injustice in our classrooms, on our campuses, and in our communities.  It strives to provide our community members with resources to interrupt cycles of racism so as to cultivate a more equitable, inclusive, and just environment for all of our students, staff, faculty, alumni, and friends, regardless of racial background. An anti-racism approach is an active and ongoing, long-term process. In all our efforts, we uphold a commitment to creating honest, respectful, supportive, and healing spaces where members of our community can meaningfully dialogue and learn from each other’s lived experiences for the betterment of our entire community.</p>

<h3 id="land-acknowledgment">Land Acknowledgment</h3>
<p>At the place George Mason University occupies, we give greetings and thanksgivings to these Potomac River life sources, the Doeg ancestors, who Virginia annihilated in violent campaigns while ripping their lands apart with the brutal system of African American enslavement, to the recognized Virginia tribes who have lovingly stewarded these lands for millennia including the Rappahannock, Pamunkey, Upper Mattaponi, Chickahominy, Eastern Chickahominy, Nansemond, Monacan, Mattaponi, Patawomeck, and Nottaway, past, present, and future, and to the Piscataway tribes, who have lived on both sides of the river from time immemorial.</p>

<h3 id="mason-gen-edmason">Mason Gen Ed/Mason</h3>
<p>This class fulfills a Mason Core requirement for Arts. Mason courses in the film making, visual and performing arts stress generative, inquiry-based learning through direct aesthetic and creative experience in the studio environment. Art history courses address the intrinsic relationship of personal and cultural creativity, and the manifestation of aesthetics, visual culture, and visual narrative within historical contexts.</p>

<p>Arts goal: Courses aim to achieve a majority of the following learning outcomes: students will be able to identify and analyze the formal elements of a particular art form using vocabulary appropriate to that form; demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between artistic technique and the expression of a work’s underlying concept; analyze cultural productions using standards appropriate to the form and cultural context; analyze and interpret material or performance culture in its social, historical, and personal contexts; and engage in the artistic process, including conception, creation, and ongoing critical analysis.</p>
