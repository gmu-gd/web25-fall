<p>Words on their own carry a lot of meaning. That meaning can be emphasized by how the type is treated. In a very simple example, look at the difference between “bold” and “BOLD”. The word didn’t change but making the word all caps and bold made the word more impactful. For this exercise, you will be visually expressing the meaning of the words by making typographic transformations to those words.</p>

<p>Pick five of the words in the list below and set each one on its own 7”x7” white piece of paper in black <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/futura-pt">Futura Bold</a>. You can express the meaning of a word or an idea through spacing, sizing, and placement of letters of each word on the page. This means you should think about things such as point size, tracking, kerning, capitalization, weight, and position of the word and its letters on the page. You should not be altering the letter forms themselves. That means you should not stretch or squish the letters in any direction. Also do not have anything other than the word on the page.</p>

<p>To focus on typographic concepts and hierarchy while still seeing letters as forms.</p>

<h4 id="assignment">Assignment</h4>
<p>Find a typeface from Adobe fonts and design a 3 page, 6x9 inch type specimen that presents the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Typeface name</li>
  <li>Multiple weights/widths/sizes of the typeface (as available)</li>
  <li>Type specs including classification (serif/sans serif etc), type designer, date
released, foundry, a brief description of key typeface characteristics, where it works well and where it doesn’t (best on screen, for display only, used as body copy, etc), and where it might be seen in public</li>
  <li>One typeface that pairs well with it (you can find suggestions online or you can make your own). You can use this typeface on your specimen sheet.</li>
  <li>A six-word memoir (Write your own or find one online. Ex: “Not quite what I was planning.”)</li>
  <li>One randomly assigned typography term (ex: ascender, kerning, x-height). Give the definition and show an example within your composition.</li>
  <li>Design with only two colors (black and a color). We will print and bind the final designs in class.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first page should act as a cover and include the typeface name and designer along with your name. The second and third page should act as a spread.</p>

<p>The goal of a specimen is to showcase all the aspects of the type. Use multiple sizes and weights of the typeface. Also keep in mind all of the design and typography terms and tools we have learned so far (kerning, leading, tracking, paragraph marking, paragraph alignment, et cetera). If you are setting paragraphs do not use a return to space the paragraphs out. Use the space after or before in the paragraph style option.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>6”x9” page size</li>
  <li>uses a grid</li>
  <li>two typefaces</li>

<p>Use the three provided grids (PDFs on Blackboard) and create layouts on them physically or digitally.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Physical Layouts – cut pieces from magazines, newspapers, packinging, etc. and glue them onto the page adhering to the grid. This means you will need to measure the space you want to fill and cut a piece out to fit that space.</li>
  <li>Digital Layouts – take screenshots of websites (text and images) and use those screenshots to place into the grid. The screenshots need to be cropped to fit precisely into the grid.</li>
</ul>

<p>The grids should be strictly adhered to while creating your layouts and should keep in mind the hierarchy of the page.The layouts should be abstract and use images and text but they do not need to represent an actual layout with words and pictures. The grid does not need to be full and there should be open white space in your final layout.</p>

<h5 id="requirements">Requirements</h5>
<ul>
  <li>three layouts using the three grids</li>
  <li>text and images on the layouts that adhere to the grid</li>
  <li>images added to figma</li>

<p>On five 6” squares, present a section of a letterform that highlights its unique characteristics, keeping in mind the contrast between form and counterform. Each of your crops will use a typeface from Adobe fonts that fits into one of the following typeface classifications: any serif, modern serif, slab serif, any sans serif, script, blackletter. Once you find a typeface that fits the appropriate category, select a letter and crop into it. The crop should ideally focus on one of the aspects that identifies that classification of type but could also focus on something unique about that specific letter. The original letter does not necessarily need to be recognizable but the specific characteristic you are looking at should. Include the name and designer of the typeface in 10pt Acumin Pro Bold (on Adobe fonts).</p>
