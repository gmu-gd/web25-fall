#### Exercise 2: Linking in Figma
Link the artboards of your e1 file together by adding some kind of navigation. How you link them together is up to you but the minimum is 1 should go to 2, 2 should go to 3, 3 should go to 4, 4 should go to the new 5th page and 5 should go back to 1. This is also a chance to update the design if you need to either to improve it or to adjust for the navigation elements.

##### Technical Requirements
* Add an additional artboard as number 5 that tells the typeface(s) and foundry(s) that designed it
* Each artboard from e1 linked to the next, with the last going back to the first
* Link to a new working prototype on your class website
